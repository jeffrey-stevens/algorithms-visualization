# Todo

* Don't hard-code random array range
  * Set range to 0 - 1
  * Use D3's scaleLinear() function instead
* Remove hard-coded dimensions
* The color transitions should be faster...
* Change snake case variables and functions to camel case
* Need to clarify the conceptual model of array indexing
* Clean up functions in Mergesort


## Issues

* Handle arrays of length 0 or 1

## Improvements

* In Mergesort, have underline bars show full split groupings
  * I.e. Show the inactive half in gray and the active half in black

## Features


## Algorithms

* Radix sort
