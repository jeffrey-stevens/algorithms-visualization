Visualization is one of the most powerful ways to understand difficult concepts.  This project explores the use of animation to visualize computational algorithms.

The visualizations were written in Javascript and D3.js.

Currently the following algorithms are implemented:

* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Quicksort
* Mergesort
